## What is the eAtlasSearchEngine

## Indexation library

We are using ElasticSearch for our indexation library.
ElasticSearch is based on Lucene.

Pros (over Lucene):
* Friendly layer of abstraction
* JSON based documents
* Distributed indexes (if needed)
* Support spatial search using GeoJSON
* Easy to integrate with Cloud base system such as AWS
